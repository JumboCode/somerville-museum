                            Please return your items in the same or better condition than when you received them. 
                            If changes in condition have occurred, please let us know. Some issues that arise include 
                            the loss of a button or hook.  Please try to find these items and keep these with the garment 
                            when you return it. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            White or off-white garments made out of cotton, such as socks, shirts, or womenâ€™s shirts 
                            or chemise, should be cleaned before returning.  These objects can be washed in a washing 
                            machine on delicate cycle with a fragrance-free detergent and dried in a dryer on low heat. 
                            Do not overheat or some shrinking may occur. Hang these items on hangers when taking them out 
                            of the dryer to reduce wrinkling until you have time to bring them back to the Museum. When 
                            folding them to fit in your bag, try to smooth out the wrinkles.
